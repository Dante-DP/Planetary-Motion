    "\n",
    "Using acceleration and the Velocity Verlet algorithm we can compute the geometry of our model, and the resulting shadows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let S be the Sun and M be the Moon, since sunlight comes from the Sun we can say the vector $\\vec{SM}$ is in the direction of sunlight (since sunlight comes from the Sun) and shadows are just the absence of light, they travel in the same direction. Converting this to a unit vector gives us the direction of the shadow axis:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{Direction of Shadow} = \\frac{\\vec{SM}}{||\\vec{SM}||}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Now we want to find out how much of the Earth lies in the direction of the shadow, using this we can find out if Earth is in the shadow cast by the Sun. as $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ = $\\lVert \\vec{a} \\rVert \\lVert \\vec{b} \\rVert \\cos{\\theta}$ when $\\lVert \\vec{b} \\rVert = 1$ then this gives us the shadow's projection, how much of vector **a** lies in the direction of **b** (the shadow axis) by $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$ = $\\lVert \\vec{a} \\rVert \\cos{\\theta}$ Now because we have length of the projection, multiplying it by the shadow direction gives us the projection of the Earth onto the shadow axis. Intuitively, this projection is the side such that imagine the plane in which the Moon and the Earth exist, the hypotenuse of this triangle is the $\\vec{ME}$ and the adjacent side is the projection, the angle is formed at the Moon. As this is the case, we can work out the perpendicular displacement from the Earth to the shadow axis by doing $\\vec{ME}$ - projection and then by taking the magnitude gives us the perpendicular distance. Why is this important? Because it tells us how much of the Earth will be covered by shadow. Large perpendicular distances tell us that the shadow is unlikely to intersect Earth but a small perpendicular distance tells us that more of the Earth is covered by the shadow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing for an Eclipse\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now test for an eclipse using this knowledge. Since we have the criteria for an eclipse, all we need to test is that there exists a portion of Earth that exists in either the umbra or penumbra. There exist approximate formulas for the Umbra Length, the Umbra Radius and the Penumbra Radius (We will assume they are exact as they are a very good approximation).\n",

    "From the criteria of an eclipse, we know that a total eclipse is when the Earth intersects the umbral shadow. If the Earth intersects the penumbral shadow but not the umbral shadow then it is a partial or annular eclipse. A partial eclipse is when the umbral shadow exists but does not intersect Earth, but the Earth does lie in the penumbra.\n",
    "\\\n",
    "If on the other hand the umbra can't reach the Earth but does lie in the penumbral shadow then it is an annular eclipse (the Moon blocks the Sun but not completely and is in the center so you see an annulus). If it doesn't intersect either then it's not an eclipse.\n",

    "## The Rough Scan\n",
    "\n",
    "We technically have enough to run a computation as to where the eclipses may lie, but it will be incredibly computationally expensive. We choose to run 2 scans instead. A scan to check for eclipses using necessary but not sufficient conditions to determine if an eclipse can occur that is significantly less computationally expensive than a full scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose to use 2 conditions to whittle down candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Moon is between the Earth and the Sun\n",
    "\n",
    "- The angle that the vector $\\vec{MS}$ and $\\vec{ME}$ needs to form is 180 degrees. It's less computationally expensive to compute the cosine of the angle as we can use the vector dot product to compute the cosine of the angle. and the cosine of 180 degrees corresponds to -1 so instead of having to use an arccos function we can just directly compare the cosine of the angle.\n",
    "\\\n",
    "- To be completely exact we should check for $\\cos{\\theta}=-1$ however instead we check for $\\cos{\\theta}<-0.995$ this is to account for approximations made by our model. Initially this was programmed to be -0.9999 however the tolerance was reduced to be -0.995 as the code omitted partial eclipses in the scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Moon is close to the Ecliptic Plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially we programmed the code without this condition, and the amount of possible candidates shot up to a couple thousand candidates instead of a few hundred. This condition helped us reduce the amount of false positives significantly.\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Firstly, what is the ecliptic plane? It is the plane in which the Moon must intersect to be an eclipse, that is the plane in which the Earth is orbiting the Sun in. We can calculate the normal to this plane by considering the initial velocity and initial position vector of the Earth, we know these two vectors are coplanar, hence by taking the cross product we can get the normal of the plane. Dividing this by its magnitude gives us the unit normal vector of the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "h_E = \\vec{r_e} \\times \\vec{v_e} \\implies \\hat{h}_E = \\frac{h_E}{\\lVert h_E \\rVert}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this we can define the ecliptic plane by the vectors that satisfy $r \\cdot \\hat{h}_E = 0$ since the vector $\\hat{h}_E$ is a unit vector, taking the dot product of the position vector of the Moon and the unit normal of the ecliptic plane gives us the projection of the Moon onto the ecliptic plane, telling us how far the Moon is from the ecliptic plane. Ideally, we accept vectors such that $|r \\cdot \\hat{h}_E| = 0$ however to account for approximations we accept vectors such that $|r \\cdot \\hat{h}_E| < \\text{tolerance}$ Intersection points to the ecliptic plane are called nodes, hence we've named in the code the tolerance as nodeTolerance. The value we chose was an acceptable balance between computational cost and accuracy.\n",
    "\\\n",
    "If at time t the geometry adheres to both of these conditions we append the time to a list of times. We then integrate using the velocity verlet algorithm and check at the next time step\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning the list\n",
    "\n",
    "We then clean the list, removing times that correspond to the same eclipse. This will significantly reduce computation time by checking that the time is not the same as in the eclipses estimates list or within a day of the previous time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Fine Scan\n",
    "\n",
    "The fine scan is where we expend our computational resources to get an accurate estimate as to where our eclipses lie.\\\n",
    "Firstly from our cleaned list of times of eclipse estimates we check the times around it by a day, and then check the times around it in fine time steps.\n",
    "But we have to check the position by integrating from our initial time and then getting to our region that we are checking, we integrate in coarse time steps outside the region we are concerned about (dt = 1800) we chose dt = 1800 in this region because any less and we significantly increase computation time and any higher and we decrease accuracy, dt = 1800 is a good compromise. Within the region we are concerned about our dt=10 which gives us a very accurate approximation of the geometry of our system, within the system we use the spatialGeometry function that we have defined to check every time step within the range that we are concerned about and check for the lowest perpendicular distance between the shadow axis and the Earth the lowest perpendicular distance will be our estimate for our central time. We append this to a list as well as the distance from the Moon to the Sun and the distance from the Moon to the Earth as well as the time at which this occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Printing our eclipses\n",
    "\n",
    "With our list, we input the elements of the list into our eclipse test function to find out what type of eclipse the fine scan list has given us.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In Question 9 we successfully simulated the orbits of the Earth and the Moon in a heliocentric reference frame under Newtonian gravity and the velocity verlet algorithm. Using our method we were able to correctly predict 23 solar eclipses to within a few hours of the eclipses actually occuring with only a few mismatches to the labels of the eclipses. The ability to solve the question demonstrates how we can relatively accurately predict solar eclipses using average computational power.\\\n",
