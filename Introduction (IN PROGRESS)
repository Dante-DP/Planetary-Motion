## Introduction

In this project, we explore the motion of planets through a vast range of numerical techniques. We start by verifying the accuracy of the velocity Verlet algorithm in solving Newton's equations of motion for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator by plotting both numerical and analytical solutions. Following this, we estimate how the Earth moves around the sun by simulating an earth-like planet's orbit given certain assumptions, which are stated later on.
