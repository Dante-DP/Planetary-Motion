## Introduction

In this project, we explore the motion of planets through a vast range of numerical techniques. We start by verifying the accuracy of the velocity Verlet algorithm in solving Newton's equations of motion for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator by plotting both numerical and analytical solutions. 
Following this, we estimate how the Earth moves around the sun by simulating an earth-like planet's orbit given certain assumptions, which are stated later on.
Our fourth section looks at how varying starting conditions can lead to different orbital shapes: ellipses, hyperbolae and, in a specific case, a parabola. For bounded elliptical trajectories we compute perihelion, aphelion, eccentricity, and
other orbital parameters to further explore what determines the shape of an orbit. We also examined how escape velocity is determined from energy considerations, comparing our numerical results with theoretical predictions.
Finally, our extension looks at the prediction of solar eclipses. We extend our simulation to a three-body problem involving the Sun, Earth and Moon; modelling their motion from given starting conditions to figure out when they will align
to form an eclipse, then identifying which type of eclipse occurs.
